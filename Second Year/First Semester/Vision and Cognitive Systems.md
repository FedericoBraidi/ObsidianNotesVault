What does it mean to see? 

We could interpret it as having a computerized way of what we do when we see. We should then have a sensing device and an interpreting device that allows us to understand what is present in a given image.

Some of the main challenges in seeing are:

- Illumination and Shadows
- Scale and Perspective
- Viewpoint
- Deformation
- Occlusion
- Clutter
- Intra-class variations
- Inter-class similarities

There are two main goals in computer vision:

- Gaining 3D metric information (i.e. reconstructing a 3D image from 2D ones)
- Gaining semantic information (i.e. understanding what objects are in the image)

The second is the focus of this course.
