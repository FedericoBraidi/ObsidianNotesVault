#### What is a game?
>[!definition] Game
> A game is a multi-person multi-objective problem.

We would like the problems to be described by easy mathematical models, so that we can better find solutions. Single-player problems are usually much simpler than multi-player. In these cases the uncertainties are only related to lack of information, random noise and approximations.
When we are faced with more complex multi-player games an additional uncertainty is added, which is related to the actions of other players. Anyways, to study these kinds of games effectively we must make two assumptions:

- The rules of the game are known in advance.
- The players are rational.
#### Decision problems

>[!definition] Decision problem
>We can define a decision problem as one that has three elements:
>- Actions: elements of a set $A$ which are what can be decided upon.
>- Outcomes: the possible results of the actions in $A$.
>- Preferences: A way to describe what outcomes are preferable for the decider.
##### Preference
>[!definition] Preference
>A preference is a relationship $\geq$ on $A$. If $a \geq b$ then $a$ is ranked above $b$.

Preferences can be:
- Complete: $\forall \, a,b \in A$ then $a \geq b$ or $b \geq a$ or both.
- Transitive: $\forall \, a,b,c \in A, a \geq b \,\, \text{and} \,\, b \geq c \rightarrow a \geq c$ 
If a preference is both complete and transitive it is called rational.
##### Utility functions
>[!definition] Utilities
>A utility (or payoff) function is an arbitrary function $u(q)$ that quantifies the goodness coming from an input $q$.

They are usually increasing functions of $q$ and have $u'(q) \geq 0, u''(q) \leq 0$ .
The formulation of $u$ doesnâ€™t matter but if $u(q) \geq u(q')$ a rational player prefers $q$ over $q'$ .

We say that $u$ represents $\geq$ if $\forall \, a,b \in A$: $a \geq b \Leftrightarrow u(a) \geq u(b)$ .
